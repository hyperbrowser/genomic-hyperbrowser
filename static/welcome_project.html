                        </h2>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                            A broad variety of chip- and high throughput sequencing-based methods produce sets of genomic regions as their main output.
                            Hence, the statistical analysis of genomic colocalization is a fundamental approach for integrative genomics.
                            Since individual genomic datasets may be affected by noise, experimental artifacts or particularities of individual donors or cell types,
                            it would be preferable to search for signals associated with sets of related experimental datasets. However, such analyses are challenging to
                            devise due to the many dependencies along the genome and across related genomic features, and no principled methodology is currently available for such investigations.


                        </p>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                        We here consider the question of whether two sets of genomic datasets differ significantly in their degree of colocalization with a reference genomic feature.
                            For instance, the two sets could be two active chromatin sets, and the reference feature GWAS SNPs, so the investigation of interest would be in which chromatin
                            set the GWAS SNPs are more active. The problem involves two main challenges; the often strong and varying degree of dependence between related (epi-)genomic features,
                            and the general hidden confounders influencing both the expected value and variance of colocalization between datasets. We define three benchmarks that together reflect
                            these main challenges. We propose several alternative analytical approaches and investigate their behavior on the defined benchmarks, as well as applying those methods on a
                            real biological case. We show that a non parametric approach based on a rank-order test statistic perform adequately on all three defined benchmarks.

                                            <li>
                                                <div>
                                                    Letâ€™s assume that we want to re-run the element <b>â€˜27: Benchmark One - T-testâ€™</b>. For doing that, we need to click on the name of the element. Three new symbols will appear. By clicking on the third symbol starting from the right (â€˜run this jobâ€™):
                                                </div>

                                                <div class="imgzoom">
                                                    <img src="../static/project/step4.png"  style="width: 80%; margin-top: 10px;margin-bottom: 15px" />

                                                </div> The main page will change and look like the following:
                                                <div class="imgzoom">
                                                    <img src="../static/project/step5.png"  style="width: 80%; margin-top: 10px;margin-bottom: 15px" />
                                                </div>
                                                Now the element in the first selection box is the reference track, while in the second selection box, we have the case-control tracks.
                                                The third selection box shows the name of the column with case-controls labels.
                                                In this example we used as null model the 'T-test', the Forbes coefficient as similarity measure, the avarage as within group summary function and the right tailed test.

                                                <p>
                                                Now, we can â€˜Executeâ€™ the analysis by clicking on the â€˜Executeâ€™ command at the bottom of the page, and the new history element will start to run.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                The new history element is initially yellow while the job is running and will become green when the results are ready:
                                                </p>
                                                <div class="imgzoom">
                                                    <img src="../static/project/step6.png"  style="width: 80%; margin-top: 10px;margin-bottom: 15px" />
                                                </div>
                                            </li>

                                            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">By clicking on the â€˜eyeâ€™ of the element is possible to see the results of the analysis:
                                                <div class="imgzoom">
                                                    <img src="../static/project/step7.png"  style="width: 80%; margin-top: 10px;margin-bottom: 15px" />
                                                </div> The name of the element is <b>â€˜Group difference test - Benchmark Oneâ€™</b>, however by clicking on the symbol â€˜editâ€™ it is possible to rename the element depending on the analysis carried out, as we did for all the history elements.
                                            </li>

                                            <li>By clicking on â€˜Import table to history (tabular)â€™ at the top of the table, a tabular format of the results is added to the history (element 31):
                                                <div class="imgzoom">
                                                    <img src="../static/project/step8.png"  style="width: 80%; margin-top: 10px;margin-bottom: 15px" />
                                                </div>
                                            </li>

                                            <li>Finally, the results can be download, by clicking on the name of the element and then on the download symbol:
                                                <div class="imgzoom">
                                                    <img src="../static/project/step9.png"  style="width: 80%; margin-top: 10px;margin-bottom: 15px" />
                                                </div>
                                                <div>
                                                    This last step, allows the user to download the data and plot the results by using the chosen software.
                                                </div>
                                            </li>
                                        </ol>
                                    </div>
