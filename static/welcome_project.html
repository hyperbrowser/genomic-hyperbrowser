Although the presence of assembly gaps causes slight reduction in the mapping rate in many experimental settings, that does not invalidate the typical statistical testing comparing read count distributions across experimental conditions. However, we hypothesize that the presence of assembly gaps and not handling them in the null model confounds the statistical testing of co-localization of genomic features.</p><p class="paragraph">Results First, we performed a series of explorative analyses to understand whether and how the public genomic tracks intersect the assembly gaps track (hg19). The findings rightly confirm that the genomic regions in public genomic tracks intersect very little with assembly gaps and the intersection was observed only at the beginning and end regions of the assembly gaps rather than covering the whole gap sizes. Further, we simulated a set of the query and reference genomic tracks in a way that nullified any dependence between them to test our hypothesis that not avoiding assembly gaps in the null model would result in spurious inflation of statistical significance. We then contrasted the distributions of test statistics and p-values of Monte Carlo simulation-based permutation tests that either avoided or not avoided assembly gaps in the null model when testing for significant co-localization between a pair of query and reference track. We observed that the statistical tests that did not account for the assembly gaps in the null model resulted in a distribution of p-values that are highly skewed to the left (more significant findings) and a distribution of increased test statistic that is shifted to the right. </p><p class="paragraph">Conclusions These observations confirm our hypothesis that not accounting for assembly gaps in statistical testing of co-localization analysis would result in false-positive and over-optimistic findings.</p></div></div>
