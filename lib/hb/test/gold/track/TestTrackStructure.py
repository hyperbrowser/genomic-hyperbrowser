#Unit test for aspects/methods in TrackStructureV2
#To be filled in by various team members - according to different tasks in Trello list:
#  "Finalize first statistic using new TS (branch:first_new_ts_stat)"
#See one of the other tests for how to make a unit test - e.g. TestTrackFormat.py
#I (GKS) don't know which git process will be the easiest here -
# I expect the easiest might be to just develop in the branch first_new_ts_stat and commit often,
# but another possibility may be to make separate feature branches and merge in again..
