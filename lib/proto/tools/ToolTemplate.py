        ProTo parser looks for a class method named::

                OrderedDict from key to selection status (bool).

        **Note about the "Galaxy dataset info" data structure**

        "Galaxy dataset info" is a list of strings coding information about a
        Galaxy history element and its associated dataset, typically used to
        provide info on the history element selected by the user as input to a
        ProTo tool.

        Structure::

            ['galaxy', fileFormat, path, name]

        Optionally encoded as a single string, delineated by colon::

            'galaxy:fileFormat:path:name'

        Where:
            * *'galaxy'* is used for assertions in the code
            * *fileFormat* (or suffix) contains the file format of the dataset,
              as encoded in the 'format' field of a Galaxy history element.
            * *path* (or file name/fn) is the disk path to the dataset file.
              Typically ends with 'XXX/dataset_YYYY.dat'. XXX and YYYY are
              numbers which are extracted and used as an unique id  of the
              dataset in the form [XXX, YYYY]
            * *name* is the title of the history element

        The different parts can be extracted using the functions
        :py:func:`proto.CommonFunctions.extractFileSuffixFromDatasetInfo()`,
        :py:func:`proto.CommonFunctions.extractFnFromDatasetInfo()`, and
        :py:func:`proto.CommonFunctions.extractNameFromDatasetInfo()`.
